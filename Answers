 1. Why does `FixedArrayQueue` require an explicit constructor?
   - To make sure that the fixedarrayqueue uses the current values and not have them as
     variables that can change, it also makes the functionality for the other functions easier.
 2. What happens when you offer an item to a full `FixedArrayQueue`?
   - It will return with " Queue is at capacity, please try later."
 3. What happens when you poll an empty `FixedArrayQueue`?
   - It will return null.
 4. What is the time and (extra) space complexity of each of the `FixedArrayQueue` methods?
   - O(1).
